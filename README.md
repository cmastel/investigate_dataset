# Investigation into Factors Effecting Improved Quality of Life in the Least Developed Countries

It has been a goal of many people in the developed world to help the least developed countries improve the quality of life for the people living there. However, it is typically difficult to determine how is the best way to provide assistance, and what measures should be used to determine succcess.


This investigation looks over a couple of potential measure of success - Annual income per person, and percentage of children completing primary school. These measures are looked at to determine if there appears to be a correlation between them, as well as looking at some specific qualities of each.


As there are a multitude of potential factors which could bring about a positive change, this investigation only looks at a couple: Electricy usage per person and access to improved (i.e. clean) drinking water. The general assumption is that if people had reliable access to electricity or clean drinking water, there would be an increase in school attendance and ultimately GDP.
